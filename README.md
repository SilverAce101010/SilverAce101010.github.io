Hi, I'm Isaac — a long time programming enthusiast with a passion for creating video games. From a young age, I’ve been captivated by the world of code and game development, constantly exploring new ways to bring my ideas to life through interactive experiences. Whether it's designing gameplay mechanics or writing code, I’m driven by a deep curiosity and love for building things that are both fun and functional.

Over the years, my early fascination has evolved into a dedicated pursuit. I’ve spent countless hours experimenting with different engines, and design tools — learning not just how to make games, but how to make them engaging, intuitive, and enjoyable to play. I’m always exploring new mechanics, refining my problem-solving skills, and pushing myself to turn abstract ideas into fully realized interactive experiences.

Game development, for me, is the perfect blend of art and logic. Whether I'm debugging a tricky system, or designing the feel of a game mechanic, I approach every challenge with curiosity. I believe in building things that are both memorable, and meaningful for players.

Bellow are some examples of projects I have worked on;
